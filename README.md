Forage Accenture Data Analysis Internship - Social Buzz Project
Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the Forage virtual internship with Accenture, focusing on analyzing social buzz data using SQL, Excel, and Power Query. The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to extract meaningful insights about the company's social media performance and user engagement.

Tools and Technologies Used
SQL: For data extraction, filtering, and analysis from the dataset.
Microsoft Excel: For creating interactive dashboards to visualize key insights.
Power Query: For data cleaning, transformation, and shaping.
PowerPoint: For presenting SQL code workflow and Excel dashboard insights.
Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning with Power Query
The dataset contained raw social buzz data that needed to be cleaned before analysis. Using Power Query, I performed the following steps:

Removed duplicates and missing values.
Standardized column names for consistency.
Filtered unnecessary columns.
Converted data types to ensure accuracy for analysis.
Check the detailed Power Query Steps in the Excel file attached.

2. Data Analysis with SQL
The clean data was analyzed using SQL to extract key information about the social buzz trends. Some SQL operations included:

Aggregating data to calculate the number of posts and engagement metrics over time.
Filtering content based on categories like sentiment, content type, and reaction.
Grouping data to identify which content formats (photo, video, etc.) were performing better.
Generating insights on positive vs. negative sentiment trends across the platform.
SQL scripts are available in the /SQL folder in the repository.

3. Excel Dashboard for Visualization
The cleaned and analyzed data was visualized using an interactive Excel dashboard. Key features of the dashboard include:

Slicers to filter insights by content category, sentiment type, and reaction.
Charts visualizing total posts, engagement metrics, and sentiment distribution.
Tables showing top-performing content categories and types.
This dashboard allows users to dynamically explore the data and gain insights into social media performance.

Check out the Excel Dashboard file for the full visualization report.

PowerPoint Presentation
I created a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project. It includes:

The SQL queries used to extract and analyze the data.
Screenshots and explanations of key Excel dashboard insights.
A step-by-step overview of the data cleaning process in Power Query.
The PowerPoint presentation is available in the /Presentation folder.

Conclusion
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in:

Cleaning and transforming raw data using Power Query.
Writing efficient SQL queries to extract insights.
Building interactive Excel dashboards to visualize business trends.
I demonstrated my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights that can drive decision-making and improve social media strategies.
